<h2 align="center">6502 Microprocessor Compiler That Translates High-Level Code into Executable 6502 Microprocessor Machine Code</h3>  
 <h3 align="center">Project Information</h4>
 <p align="center">
  I started and completed this project during my free time while interning at Avangrid Networks in the summer of 2024. My goal when starting this project was to gain a deeper knowledge and skill with Java through a large-scale and difficult project. This compiler is currently by far my largest project and has consumed many many hours of my life, however, as a result, I can say this project is the one I am most proud of. I created this functional 6502 microprocessor compiler through hours of headache, self-study, and determination. I want to give a big shout-out to Alan Labouseur who provided all of the materials and study information I needed to climb the mountain that was this project free of charge on <a href="https://www.labouseur.com/courses/compilers/"><strong>his website</strong></a>

  <h3 align="center">Getting Started</h3> 
    <p align="center">
  This project is split into 4 unique sub-projects, each a segment of the compiler that builds on the last segments. The final project is the FINAL complete version of the compiler. This setup was very intuitive and made the digestion of each aspect of the compiler easy and non-overwhelming. However, each project came with its own struggles and challenges which I will talk more in-depth about.

## Self-Taught and COMPLETED 7/22/2024

### My goal
##
#### The Compiler is Broken Down Into Different Projects, Each Building on The Previous One

#### Project 1: Lexical Analysis
#### Project 2: Parser
#### Project 3: Semantic Analysis
#### Project 4: Generate Machine Code


## LaTeX Writeups and Some Code Adjustments May be Required

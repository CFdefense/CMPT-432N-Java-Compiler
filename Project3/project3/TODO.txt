Project 3 - AST and Semantic Analysis

--LEX AND PARSE MUST BE SUCCESSFULL--

1. Create and Display AST from CST or tokens --- DONE

2. Semantic Analysis -> Scope Checks and Type Checks the AST

3. Create and Display Symbol Table with type and Scope Information

Important::
While Scope-Checking 
    -> build symbol table of Symbols which includes [Name, datatype, scope, position, etc]

Type check source code using AST and symbol table

Errors -> undeclared identifiers, redeclared identifiers in same scope, type mismatch, etc.

Warnings -> variables declarded/declared and initialized but unused, used variables without initialization



--TODO--

Continue Work for Semantics
1. display print hashtable -> Done -> test a little
2. Do Warnings implementation -> Doing now -> 
    Update isInit when Initialized
    Check and throw Warning when variable is used without initialization
3. Work on conclusions of semantic
4. Next Steps CONTINUE OR NO?? ERRORS?

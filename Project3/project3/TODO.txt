Project 3 - AST and Semantic Analysis

--LEX AND PARSE MUST BE SUCCESSFULL--

1. Create and Display AST from CST or tokens --- DONE

2. Semantic Analysis -> Scope Checks and Type Checks the AST

3. Create and Display Symbol Table with type and Scope Information

Important::
While Scope-Checking 
    -> build symbol table of IDS which includes [Name, datatype, scope, position, etc]

Type check source code using AST and symbol table

Errors -> undeclared identifiers, redeclared identifiers in same scope, type mismatch, etc.

Warnings -> declared but unused identifiers, use of unitialized variables, initialized used variables


--TODO--

Continue Work for Semantics
currScope recursion might be off
Do Init changes!

-> need use hashTable id|type,isInit,isUsed
-> need scope tree (enhanced symbol table)

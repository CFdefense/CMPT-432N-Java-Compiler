 <p align="center">
  I started and completed this project during my free time while interning at Avangrid Networks in the summer of 2024. My goal when starting this project was to gain a deeper knowledge and skill with Java through a large-scale and difficult project. This compiler is currently by far my largest project and has consumed many many hours of my life, however, as a result, I can say this project is the one I am most proud of. I created this functional 6502 microprocessor compiler through hours of headache, self-study, and determination. I want to give a big shout-out to Alan Labouseur who provided all the materials and study information I needed to climb the mountain that was this project FREE on <a href="https://www.labouseur.com/courses/compilers/"><strong>his website</strong>)</a>

## Self-Taught and COMPLETED 7/22/2024

### My goal
##
#### The Compiler is Broken Down Into Different Projects, Each Building on The Previous One

#### Project 1: Lexical Analysis
#### Project 2: Parser
#### Project 3: Semantic Analysis
#### Project 4: Generate Machine Code


## LaTeX Writeups and Some Code Adjustments May be Required
